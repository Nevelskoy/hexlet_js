You are given a state for a rectangular board game grid with chips in a binary matrix, where 1 is a cell with a chip and 0 is an empty cell. You are also given the coordinates for a cell in the form of row and column numbers (starting from 0). You should determine how many chips are close to this cell. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours; those cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
